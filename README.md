Data transformation in Power Query

Data modeling and building parameters using DAX

Build dashboard in Power BI

Collect insights from the dashboard and select the final 11 players

## Data Sources

The data for this project was scraped from [ESPN Cricinfo], a website that provides comprehensive coverage of cricket news, scores, and statistics. The data contains information about the players' performance in the T20 format, such as batting average, strike rate, bowling average, economy rate, etc.

## Tools Used

The tools used for this project are:

- Python: A programming language that was used to scrape the data from ESPN Cricinfo using the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries.
- SQL: A query language that was used to analyze and manipulate the data using various functions and aggregations.
- Power BI: A business intelligence platform that was used to create the dashboard using various visualizations and filters.

## Dashboard Features

The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of the players' performance in the T20 format, and allows the user to select the best 11 players based on multiple criteria, such as:

- Team: The user can filter the data by the team name, and see the players' performance for that team.
- Role: The user can filter the data by the player's role, such as batsman, bowler, all-rounder, or wicket-keeper, and see the players' performance for that role.
- Metrics: The user can filter the data by the metrics that are relevant for the player's role, such as batting average, strike rate, bowling average, economy rate, etc., and see the players' performance for those metrics.

The dashboard also provides some interactive features, such as:

- Slicers: The user can use the slicers to adjust the filters and see the updated data and visualizations.
- Tooltips: The user can hover over the visualizations to see more details and information about the data points.
- Drill-through: The user can right-click on a data point and drill through to another page that shows more details and analysis about that data point.

The dashboard consists of three pages:

- Overview: This page shows the overview of the players' performance in the T20 format, and allows the user to select the best 11 players based on multiple criteria.
- Batting: This page shows the detailed analysis of the players' batting performance in the T20 format, and allows the user to drill through to see more details about a specific player.
- Bowling: This page shows the detailed analysis of the players' bowling performance in the T20 format, and allows the user to drill through to see more details about a specific player.
